# Example tbdex remittance mock PFI servers

This is an example project that mocks 5 PFI servers using the tbdex protocol.

Currently mocks five PFI servers and can be extended.

This example will:

* A server which does an "OFAC" check on the customer and issues a verifiable credential only if they are not on the OFAC list.
* Five tbdex protocol implementation that mocks 5 participating financial institutions.

See [main.ts](src/main.ts) for the liquidity node code (server).

NOTE: this is not using market rates, or anything sensible, and is not intended to showcase all regulatory requirements that must be fulfilled. This is for illustrative purposes only, not production use.
For a more general exemplar for a PFI liquidity node, please take a look at: https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex-pfi-exemplar/ (which also includes a database, this one does not).

This project is a fork of https://github.com/TBD54566975/example-pfi-aud-usd-tbdex


# Development Prerequisites

## `node` and `npm`
This project is using `node v20.3.1` and `npm >=v7.0.0`. You can verify your `node` and `npm` installation via the terminal:

```
$ node --version
v20.3.1
$ npm --version
9.6.7
```

If you don't have `node` installed, feel free to choose whichever installation approach you feel the most comfortable with. If you don't have a preferred installation method, we recommend using `nvm` (aka node version manager). `nvm` allows you to install and use different versions of node. It can be installed by running `brew install nvm` (assuming that you have homebrew)

Once you have installed `nvm`, install the desired node version with `nvm install vX.Y.Z`.


## Step 0: Setup server

(this is a step you only need to do once).

> ðŸ’¡ Make sure you have all the [prerequisites](#development-prerequisites)
Install dependencies

```npm install```

## Step 1: Run liquidity node (server)

Run the server (or restart it) in another terminal window:

`npm run server`

# Implementing a PFI

The business logic for the PFI is mainly in [main.ts](src/main.ts) and the offerings as specified in [offerings.ts](src/offerings.ts). Each server port is also set up in [config.ts](src/config.ts). Poke around!

Each interaction happens in the context of an "Exchange" which is a record of the interaction between the customer and the PFI.


# Configuration
Configuration can be set using environment variables. Defaults are set in `src/config.ts`
